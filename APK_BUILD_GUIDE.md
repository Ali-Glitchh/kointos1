# üì± How to Build Kointos APK File - Complete Guide

## üéØ Option 1: Local Development Setup (Recommended)

### Prerequisites:
1. **Android Studio** - Download from https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **Flutter SDK** - Download from https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
3. **Java JDK 8+** - Required for Android development

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. Setup Android Development Environment
```bash
# Install Android Studio and accept licenses
flutter doctor --android-licenses

# Verify setup
flutter doctor
```

#### 2. Clone and Setup Project
```bash
# Clone the project
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd kointos1

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Verify no issues
flutter analyze
```

#### 3. Build APK
```bash
# Debug APK (for testing)
flutter build apk --debug

# Release APK (for distribution)
flutter build apk --release

# Split APKs by architecture (smaller file sizes)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```

#### 4. Locate APK Files
```bash
# Debug APK location:
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk

# Release APK location:
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Split APKs:
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-x86_64-release.apk
```

## üîß Option 2: GitHub Actions (Automated)

### Setup CI/CD Pipeline:

#### Create `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`:
```yaml
name: Build APK
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '11'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        
    - name: Setup Flutter
      uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      with:
        flutter-version: '3.32.7'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: flutter pub get
      
    - name: Analyze code
      run: flutter analyze
      
    - name: Build APK
      run: flutter build apk --release
      
    - name: Upload APK
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: release-apk
        path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

## üåê Option 3: Online Build Services

### Codemagic (Recommended)
1. Go to https://codemagic.io
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure Flutter build settings
4. Automatic APK generation on commit

### GitHub Codespaces with Android SDK
```bash
# Install Android SDK in Codespace
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-7583922_latest.zip
unzip commandlinetools-linux-7583922_latest.zip
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/android-sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

## üöÄ Option 4: Quick Test APK (Current Codespace)

Let me try to set up a minimal Android SDK in the current environment:
